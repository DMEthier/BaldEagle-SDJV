These R scripts were created to accommodate the collection, compilation and correlation between numbers of Bald Eagles and sea ducks in specific regions (sub-basins) of the Salish Sea using BC Coastal Waterbird Survey, Christmas Bird Count, and other publicly accessible data sources. 

Objective: Assess the potential effect of a predator (Bald Eagle) population on long-term abundance and distribution patterns of priority sea duck species, and consider the implications the results may have for habitat modeling, and interpretation of long-term monitoring data showing ongoing 20-year declines in Surf, White-winged and Black Scoter and Long-tailed Duck in this region. 

Target regions: 
3-4 areas 
- Parksville/Qualicum to Baynes Sound
- Burrard Inlet â€“ EnglishBay - Howe Sound
- Fraser Estuary-Boundary-Semiahmoo Bays
- southern Vancouver Island.  

There will be 15-20+ survey polygons with regular count data in each region

Target sea ducks include: 
Surf Scoter: Benthivore, Long Distance Migrant
White-winged Scoter: Benthivore, Short Distance Migrant
Black Scoter: Benthivore, Long Distance Migrant
Long-tailed Duck: Benthivore, Long Distance Migrant


This research follow from: 
Middleton, H.A., R.W. Butler and P. Davidson. 2018. Waterbirds alter their distribution and behavior in the presence of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). Northwestern Naturalist, 99(1), pp.21-30. 

Hypothesis from Middleton: 
1. Flock sizes of scoters will increased with presence of eagles
2. Diving birds will moved away from shore.
